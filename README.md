CSV file which tells which of the users purchased/not purchased a particular product based on age, estimated salary.

This graph helps us see the clear correlations between the dependent and independent variables. It is obvious that, as Age and Estimated Salary increase, each individual has a higher likelihood of being green (they will click on the ad). Intuitively, the graph makes a lot of sense because we can quickly tell that about 80-90% of the observations have been correctly identified. There will almost always be some degree of error - or at least there should be, otherwise our model is probably guilty of overfitting.

This Confusion Matrix tells us that there were 89 correct predictions and 11 incorrect ones, meaning the model overall accomplished an 89% accuracy rating. This is very good and there are many ways to improve the model by parameter tuning and sample size increasing, but those topics are outside the scope of this project. Our next step is to create visualizations to compare the training set and the test set. As we've stated throughout this discussion, seeing our data and being able to visualize our work in front of us is imperative to understanding each step of the model.
